                        <p>This website was created during my time at university for a family member. The intention for this website is 
                            to allow the company to inform their local community about the takeaway and have the menu as well as contact 
                            information available. There are plan being created for the design of this website to be updated. I am currently 
                            working closely with the owner of the business to help them decide on a redesign.

                    <h3>About this website...</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created this website so that I could share my pokemon card collection with my YouTube viewers. I decided that 
                        to ensure a easyset up and maintainace I would make this website using Wordpress. This allowed me to create the 
                        website with speed and have it available to viewers to visit. Using wordpress has also allowed me to update my 
                        collection without any coding. I have been planning to redesign this website but am still working on the design.

                    <h3>About this website...</h3>
                    <p>
                        During early 2019 I was approached by a family friend to help them create a website to help them promote their 
                        cafe shop. However, there was a few huddles that I had to work through. As this client was based in Hong Kong, 
                        there was a time difference issue which sometimes made it longer for me to be able to communciate with the client
                        as most of the time when I am working it is night time for the client. But also due to the distance I was only able 
                        to communicate with my client through video conference or emails making it sometimes harder to get instant response.
                        Unfortuately the client has had to close business but has allowed me to use the files from the website in my portfoilo.

                    <h3>About this website...</h3>
                    <p>During my time at university I had a crazy business idea which I wasn't able to make possible. Instead I decided to 
                        use this idea and create a website from it. This website was created during my third year of uni during a time were I 
                        was using free time to develop on my website design and development skills. Since then I have not had a chance to look 
                        back on it but I hope I will get a chance soon to develop this more using skills I have developed since.

                    <p>This is a template website I created recently using skills which I have developed throughout my time as a freelance 
                        website design and developer. The data from this webiste is all made up so that I could make the website more real.
                        I am currently also working on further designs which I will be sharing very soon.

                    <p>This website was a recreation from a website I created for a client who was happy for me to use the files for the website 
                        but asked that I used incorrect data inside it. This is a very simple website design but for the business that this site 
                        was for it linked perfectly with their business mission statement.

                  and ensure that we feel involved in the final project. Having a website has also allowed 
                  our business to grow further as customers have been able to access our menu and contact 
                  details straight from the internet. When given any questions she will provide answers which 
                  are both professional but also easy to understand often using illistrations or sometimes filming 
                  an video to explain it. We could feel that she is very passionate with the projects she works on 
                  and have recommended her to other people.</q>

                  with different time zone she was always very happy to answer our questions and requests as soon as she 
                  can, even if it is at 3 am in the morning in the UK</q>
